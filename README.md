# employee-tracker

The contents of this repository are a command line interface employee tracker application. Deployment of this application requires a running MySQL server. The included schema.sql file must be run on the server in order for the application to work.

This application allows users to: add new departments, add new roles, add new employees, view existing departments (department id and name), view existing roles (role id, role name, department name, salary), view existing employees (employee id, first name, last name, role name, salary, manager name), and update employee roles. All of this information is stored in a database called tracker_db.
